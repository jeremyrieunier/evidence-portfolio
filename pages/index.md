# Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jeremy

I'm a data analyst based in sunny Valencia ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸. I work with ecommerce and SaaS companies, helping them build analytics capabilities, train teams, and use data to drive meaningful business decisions.

Before that, I ran my own CRM and analytics consultancy for 7 years, helping DTC Shopify stores understand their customer data better.

I'm also a lifelong st-st-stutterer with le best frrrench ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· accent ever.

## How I built this website
This website is built with [Evidence](https://evidence.dev/). Everything is publishing on GitHub ([here's the repo](https://github.com/jeremyrieunier/evidence-portfolio)) and then deployed through [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). 

The design is inspired by the [Panic theme for Logseq](https://github.com/kirso/logseq-panic-theme), created by [Kirill So](https://www.kirillso.com/).
