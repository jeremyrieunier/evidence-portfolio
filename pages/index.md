## How I built this website
This website is built with [Evidence](https://evidence.dev/). Everything is publishing on GitHub ([here's the repo](https://github.com/jeremyrieunier/evidence-portfolio)) and then deployed through [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). 

The design is inspired by the [Panic theme for Logseq](https://github.com/kirso/logseq-panic-theme), created by [Kirill So](https://www.kirillso.com/).
